# Configuration

Fireactions is configured using a YAML file. The default configuration file is located at `/etc/fireactions/config.yaml`.

You can also specify a custom configuration file using the `--config` flag when starting the Fireactions server.

Example configuration file with all available options:

```yaml
---
#
# The address to listen on for HTTP requests.
#
# Default: :8080
#
bind_address: 0.0.0.0:8080
